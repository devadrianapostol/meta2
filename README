  Meta-II
  =======


This is a simple implementation of "Meta-II", the compiler-compiler
designed by Val Schorre and presented in [1]. This variant generates C
instead of assembly code for the Meta II virtual machine, as in the
original version. I first tried to keep the intermediate stage and
have a Meta-II description for translating the pseudo-assembly to C,
but quickly hit the limitations of Meta-II itself (Meta-II
descriptions are free-format, the pseudo-assembler is not - it needs
positional information to distinguish between labels and operators).

To build the translator, you will need gcc(1), GNU make(3) and
bash(1).  Enter

  make bootstrap

to generate the initial "bootstrapping" compiler from the
pre-generated sources in the "bootstrap" directory.

  make check

will force a rebuild and compare the output of the new compiler with
the source of the current version.

To install the program in your system, enter

  make install

The default installation directories will be /usr/local/bin and
/usr/local/include. You can override the installation prefix like
this:

  make PREFIX=/home/felix install

A script named "meta2c" is also available and might be more convenient
for generating an executable directly from a parser-description.

This implementation of Meta-II was generated by a quick-and-dirty
translation of the pseudo-assembler code for the original Meta-II
implementation, which can be found at [4], together with an excellent
tutorial.

Other interesting implementations of Meta-II are available at [2] and
[3].
